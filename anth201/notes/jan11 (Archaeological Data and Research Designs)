Cultural Landscapes  -  Archaeological sites above ground


Three Typical Elements of Archaeological Research:
 - Observed material culture
 - Unobserved human / non-human activity
 - Interpretation of human activity


Material Evidence
 - Physical:
        artifacts
        features
        biofacts(ecofacts)
 - Spatial:
        activity areas
        sites
        regions


Artifact  -  Any portable object whose form has been shaped by way of human activity


Feature  -  Nonportable material evidence of human activity


Ecofacts
 - Macrofossils
	visible to the naked eye
	can be retrieved through flotation or normal excavation procedures
 - Microfossils
	can be retrieved through flotation only
	visible only under high-power magnification, 200x or greater


Attribute
 - All material evidence has attributes
 - These are observable and measurable characteristics


Activity Area
 - Localized concentration of material evidence
 - May be defined as a site depending on the nature and extent of materials


Archaeological Site
 - Can be defined in a number of ways
 - Usually consists of a collection of activity areas containing any of the following:
	artifacts
	ecofacts
	features


Archaeological Region
 - Areal distribution of archaeological evidence
 - Usually defined by natrual boundaries
 - Can display evidence of cultural homogeneity


Provenience
 - Physical and temporal location in three dimensional space
 - Site leve:    grid system
 - Regional level:    map coordinates
		      settlement features


Context
 - Association of artifacts with environmental and other material evidence
 - Can be either Primary or Secondary


Primary Context
 - Materials found where they were originally deposited
 - Can be either Use-Related or Transposed


Secondary Context
 - Materials moved after original deposition
 - Sometimes understood in terms of N-transforms and C-transforms after Schiffer (e.g., 1972)


N-Transforms
 - The natural factors that convert "systemic context" into archaeological context
 - e.g.
	weathering of exposed objects
	soil disturbance by animals


C-Transforms
 - The cultural factors that convert "systemic context" into archaeological context
 - e.g.
	recycling of objects
	re-use of building materials


Preservation and Destruction
 - Affected by:
	Natural agencies(N-transforms)
	Human agencies(C-transforms)
