Origins

 - AMH emerge between 200 and 100 kya and are found in:
    SW Asia by ca. 130 kya
    East Asia by ca. 110 kya
    Europe and Australia by ca. 45 kya
    the Americas by 15 kya
 - Some debate re: evolutionary mechanism - continuity or replacement?
 - Evidence argues against the multiregional model
    earliest fossil remains come from Africa: Omo (195 kya) and Herto (160 kya), both in Ethiopia
    forms intermediate between AHS and AMH found only in Africa
    arch. evidence for contemporaneity between AHS and AMH
    locally derived, regionally specific anatomical traits are of recent origin
 - mtDNA evidenc ealso argues against the multiregional model
    modern humans derive from a 200 kya African population (little to no interbreeding with AHS)
    remember: 8 base pair differences among extant pops., 27-28 base pair differences between Neanderthals and AMH
 - despite this, debate is ongoing


Early AMHs in Africa

 - Homo sapiens idaltu
 - fossil evidence: Herto (Ethiopia)
    three skulls, ca. 160 kya
 - crania: longer, more rugged;
    volume ~1450 cc
 - suggests development of AMH complete in Africa by 160 kya, far earlier than anywhere else


AMH Cultural Development

 - new tool kits based on antler, bone, and wood + parallel-sided stone blade technology
    pre-shaped core
    indiret percussion / punch technique
    pressure flaking / retouch
 - blade technology (e.g. Aurignacian in Europe, well developed by 30 kya)
 - blades (specialized flakes)
    longer than wide
    parallel sides
    increased efficiency
    decreased waste
 - fossil evidence for 'complex cognition': Blombos Cave (South Africa)
    extensive occupational deposits ca. 65 kya
    numerous blade tools, spear points, and possible bone points
    wide array of resources consumed: plant foods, fish, shellfish, small mammals
    earlier occupation at 75 kya has perforated shell items (ornaments) and engraved ochre
 - sites like Blombos Cave suggest greater cognitive development
    Steven Mithen (1996) - cognitive fluidity
     - previously isolated mental domains (environmental, technical, social, etc.) become more fully integrated in AMHs
     - accordingly, cognition becomes more advanced (e.g., abstract, metaphorical) and more 'fluid'
 - competitive edge over extant populations


Colonization: Australia

 - colonization of Australia by at least 40 kya
 - use of watercraft, but...
 - exposed continental shelves (now submerged) connected many offshore islands to the Asian mainland
 - Archaeological evidence: Willandra Lakes Region (SE Australia, NSW)
    earliest evidence for cremation
     - ('Mungo Lady') ca. 40 kya
    nearby ochre burial of 'Mungo Man'
     - also ca. 40 kya
    stone tools dated to ca. 46-50 kya


AMH in Europe

 - Upper Paleolithic Period
 - first AMH found in SW France in the Dordogne region (home of many Neanderthal finds)
 - anatomically indistinguishable from ourselves, but different from Neanderthals
 - settled in SE and Central Europe by 40 kya; SW France by 35 kya


AMH Tool Technology

 - advancements
    careful selection of fine-grained toolstones
    production of standardized parallel-sided blades / refinement of knapping techniques
    refinement of the burin (chisel) - enabled detailed work on antler and bone
    groove and splinter technique - enabled production of bone spear points and harpoons
 - also developed the atalal or spearthrower
 - microliths: used all over Uerasia; first appear in SE Asia (China) ~30 kya, in use oelsewhere by 25 to 20 kya
 - distinctive hafted artifacts manufactured on microblades
 - served as spear barbs, arrow points, small knives and scrapers


AMH in Eurasia

 - after 18 kya, increase in movement to the open steppe and tundra plains of northern Eurasia
    concentrations in river valleys
 - archaeological evidence - Mezhirich (Ukraine)
    complex of 4 dome-shaped houses made from mammoth skulls, jaws and limb bones, 5 m across
     - hides and sod used as covering
     - subterranean entranceways
 - mammoth bone with inscribed 'map' of region
 - site dated to 17 kya


The First Americans

 - some debate as to when people first arrived in the Americas
 - could be as early as 30 kya; likely ca. 15 kya
 - Beringia (landmass linking NE Asia with Alaska)
    now the Bering Sea
 - tracking migrating herds of caribou?
 - ca. 15 kya, much of northern North America covered by ice sheets (blocked access to south)
 - after 14 kya, sheets melted rapidly which would have allowed passage
 - earliest site, oddly, is in Chile (Monte Verde)
 - Monte Verde (Chile)
    definitely occupied by 14 kya; possibly as early as 31 kya
    good preservation of bone and wooden artifacts
    evidence for plant foods (e.g., potato)
    mastadon and camel remains also found; exploited small game
