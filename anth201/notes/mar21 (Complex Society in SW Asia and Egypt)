Mesopotamia

 - alluvial plain around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
 - encompasses much of modern-day Iraq and Syria


Environmental Context

 - low rainfall: water comes mainly from Tigris and Euphrates
 - dramatic spring floods: silt (chokes canals)
 - plain is flat & poorly drained: salinization (salt build-up)
 - wheat, barley, lentils
 - sheep, goats, cattle


Early Settlement

 - plain settled during the Formative Period (5500 - 4500 BC) by 'Ubaid culture
    farming settlements of 2-10 ha; 2 tier settlement hierarchy (villages, towns) by 4000 BC
    rectangular, mud brick homes; growth around temples
    extensive irrigation, development of potter's wheel
    rapid growth by ca. 4500 BC; world's first cities


Early City States

 - Early City-States Period (4500-3100 BC). e.g. Uruk, Eridu, Ur
    population growth - 50,000+ people by 3100 BC
    9 km long wall, 250 ha settlement by 3100 BC
    tightly-packed houses, alleyways, courtyards, workshops
    Focal points - ziggurat complexes, temples
    class-based hierarchy; craft specialization (districts in Eanna), metallurgy
    writing by ca. 3500 BC (cuneiform)
    expansion / colonization northward: trade networks


Sumerian Civilization (3100 - 2334 BC)

 - city-state based economic system (e.g. Eridu, Uruk, Ur)
    trade links with Egypt, Anatolia, and Indus valley by ca. 3000 BC
 - need for raw materials: ore, soapstone, timber, grain
    easily moved along rivers, coastlines; overland by caravans
 - bronze - Syria ca. 3000 BC; imporved agricultural technologies, yields (surpluses)
 - with increases in food production + trade and exchange come...
    greater degrees of militarism
    greater degrees of social stratification
     - e.g. Royal Cemetery at Ur


Royal Cemetery at Ur

 - dates to ca. 2600-2100 BC
 - excavated by Leonard Woolley (British Museum) 1927-1928
 - 1850 burials; 16 'royal tombs'
    kings and queens + sacrificed attendants
 - 'Standard of Ur'
    wooden box with shell, lapis lazuli inlays
    depicts battle scenes + feasts


Egyptian Civilization (5000-30 BC)

 - Predynastic
    5000-3100 BC
 - Dynastic
    3100-30 BC


Environmental Context

 - Nile River: low rainfall but predictable (spring-summer) flooding
 - use of 'passive' irrigation (e.g. dikes, basins)
    soil salinity not really a concern
 - Nile environments more 'steppe' than desert through Predynastic Period


Predynastic Period (5000-3100 BC)

 - simple farming villages tethered to Nile
 - gradual emergence of low-level chiefdoms
    disparity in trade, food surpluses, etc...
    Incipient city-states (taxes, fortifications, elite burial practices)
 - early hieroglyphic writing
 - Emergence of 3 kingdoms in Upper Egypt ca. 3300 BC
    Nagada, Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) and This (Abydos)
    Precursor to unification (proto-kingdom)
 - greater contact with SW Asia, Arabia (e.g. cylinder seals, gold)
 - military conquest (unification) by 3100 BC
    King Narmer (Menes)


Early Dynastic Period (3100-2575 BC)

 - Unification / consolidation of Lower and Upper Egypt under Narmer (Menes)
 - Emergence of:
    Pharaonic 'god-king'
    Centralized bureaucracy (capital at Memphis)
    Scribes - cursive hieroglyphic script


Old Kingdom (2575-2134 BC)

 - Full state-level society, e.g. 20,000+ army, differential mortuary practices; strict social hierarchy
 - urbanization and monumental architecture (corvee labour)
    Saqqara (Menphis) - Djoser I ca. 2650 BC
    Giza complex - Khufu ca. 2528 BC
