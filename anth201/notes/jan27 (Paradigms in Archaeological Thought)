So... what is a paradigm?
 - A philosophical framework within which theories, laws, and generalizations are formulated
 - e.g., Paradigm: Neo-Darwinism
         Scientific Schools: Biology, Zoology, etc...


Why study paradigms?
 - To understand the historical development of the discipline
 - To understand epistemological bases for interpretations
 - Because conceptual frameworks are inextricably linked to the "doing" of archaeology


Key Paradigms in Archaeology
    Evolutionary Thought    - mid to late 19th Century
    Culture History         - after 1920
    Processualism           - after 1960
    Post-Processualism      - after 1980


Evolutionary Thought
 - Rooted in notions of progress
    cultures could be arrayed from "simple" to "complex"
    considered part of the human condition
 - Fit with Darwinian explanations
 - Thoroughly Eurocentric
    key tenet: Unilinear evolution

Evolutionary Thought - Major Works
 - Lewis Henry Morgan's "Ancient Society" (1877)
    unilinear evolution
     - Savagery, Barbarism, Civilization
    Key technological inventions were
     - associated with each stage


The Birth of Culture History
 - Emerged in the late 19th Century
 - Displaced evolution as historical 'prime mover' (reaction)
 - New emphasis on peopling in time and space
    interest also in mechanisms of change(e.g., diffusion and migration)

Culture History
 - Incorporates two fundamental principles:
    Descriptive Research Methods
     - Numerous specific observations > generalization
    "Normative" View of Culture
     - Behaviour governed by abstract rules
 - Descriptive approach rooted in Artifact Styles

Cultural History - Major Works
 - V. Gordon Childe's "The Dawn of European Civilization" (1925)
    Delineated the concept of archaelogical culture


Processualism or the "New" Archaeology
 - Replaced Culture History as the dominant paradigm in North American archaeology after the 1960s
 - Brand of Neo-Evolutionary thought associated with Lewis Binford
 - Recast culture as an integrated system - "man's extrasomatic means of adaptation" to the environment
 - Processual archaeology became concerned with:
    The search for cross-cultural, law-like regularities
    A systematic view of culture, and how artifacts functioned as part of integrated whole
 - Emphasis on the hypothetico-deductive method
 - Artifacts used to illustrate the "how" and "why" of culture change
    No longer limited to description and classification
 - Artifacts as products of past (behavioral) processes
    Not simply reflections of past cultural norms


Post-Processualism
 - Loosely-knit set of complementary theories and approaches to the past
 - Popularized by the work of Ian Hodder and others beginning in the early 1980s
 - Alignment of archaeology with history, as well as sociology, gender studies, linguistics/semiotics, and technology
 - Emphasis in Post-Processualism on:
    Context
    Meaning
    Tradition (History)
    Agency
 - Return to specific, local interpretations at the expense of broader cross-cultural generalizations (cultures vs Culture)
 - Emphasis of cultural traditions as factors which play an active role in structuring cultural change
    move away from seeing groups as heavily influenced by external forces
