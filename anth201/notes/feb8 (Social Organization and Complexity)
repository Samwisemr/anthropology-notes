Social Organization and Complexity

How were societies organized?
 - Two inter-related questions:
    What was the size or scale of the society?
     - was it autonomous or interdependent?
    How can we characterize its internal structure?
     - how did they deal with issues of kinship, marriage, labour, status, ethnicity, etc.?


Size/Scale
 - One model in archaeology - Service (1962)
    Band
    Tribe
    Chiefdom
    State

 - Problems:
    Unilinear
    'Pigeon-holes'


 - Bands
    Small scale (<100 people)
    Egalitarian; informal leadership
    Tend to be highly mobile - temporary camps
    Oldest form of social organization

    Archaeological Example: all Paleolithic societies


 - Tribes
    Larger than bands (~ 1000-2000 people)
    Some (kin-based) ranking; pan-tribal sodalities
    Greater sedentism - farming, herding
    Some warfare (raiding)
    
    Archaeological Example: Neolithic societies; Iroquois


 - Chiefdoms
    Larger than tribes (~ 5000-20,000+ people)
    Kin-based ranking under hereditary leader
    Economy based on tribute / redistribution
    Settlement centres - secular & sacred
    
    Archaeological Example: NW Coast, Mississippian


 - States (Pre-Industrial)
    Larger than chiefdoms (generally 20,000+ people)
    Class-based hierarchy under king/emperor
    Laws, bureaucracy (taxation), standing armies
    Cities - palaces, temples, public buildings

    Archaeological Example: All ancient civillizations


Internal Organization
Some archaeological indicators

 - Funerary customs (Burials)
 - Trade and Exchange
 - Settlement Patterns / Systems

 - Other indicators
    Sex and Gender
    Ethnicity


Funerary Customs (Burials)
 - Burial Mode
    Primary
     - initial burial; typically fully articulated

    Secondary
     - evidence of exhumation and reburial, often as a group
     - amount of articulation varies

 - Placement of individuals within burial
    is there spatial evidence of rank, status, etc.?
 - Funerary architecture
    e.g., pyramid, passage tomb
 - Nature and extent of grave goods
    personal affects, badges of office, etc.
    can also be used to assess economic and ideational organization


Trade and Exchange
 - Can take the form of:
    Reciprocity
     - mutual exchange of items; creates obligations
    Redistribution
     - centralized; organized collection & dissemination
    Market
     - sophisticated, regulated; subject to regional and inter-regional economic forces - supply, demand, etc


Reciprocity
 - e.g., Hopewell Interaction Sphere
 - Eastern North America, ca. AD 1-500
 - Involved exchange of both raw materials (e.g., cherts, copper, marine shell) and finished goods


Settlement
 - Nature and extent of settlement features
    use of seasonal vs. fixed locales
    arrangement of sites across the landscape (Settlement Systems)
    size and internal arrangement of structures
