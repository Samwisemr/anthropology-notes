Homo erectus
 - Transition to more advanced hominin forms, i.e., H. ergaster (?) and H. erectus ca. 1.9 mya
    ca. 1.5 mya: 5 or 6 extant hominin species
    ca. 1 mya: onlly H. ergaster and H. erectus
 - Transition coincides, roughly with the start of the Pleistocene


The Pleistocene
 - Geological 'epoch' or time period
    aka the Ice Age; ca. 2.6 mya - 12,000 BP
 - Characterized by cyclical cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) climatic conditions
 - During glacial maxima, 30% of the earth's surface covered by ice sheets
 - On the ice sheets:
    Several kilometres thick
     - Major geomorphological consequences
    Huge volume of water tied up
     - Sea level drops in the order of 100-200 metres
     - Consequence: littoral sites now submerged
     - Consequence: less rainfall, desserts drier & more expansive


Homo erectus
 - Likely evolved from H. habilis
    trasitional specimens yet to be documented
 - Some consider 'African' sp. to be H. ergaster
 - Earliest forms come from East Africa
    ca. 1.8 mya, Lake Turkana, northern Kenya
 - Anatomical traits (crania)
    heavy brow ridges (supraorbital torus)
    larger, more orthognathous face (compared to H. habilis)
    high forehead (compared to Australopithecines)
    long, low braincase; approx. 700-900 cc
 - Anatomical traits (post-crania)
    shorter arms, longer legs (terrestrial existence)
 - Emerged out of (same as?) H. ergaster
    European/East Asian form; subject of debate
 - Earliest specimens found in East Africa
    ca. 1.9 mya - 200,000 BP
    ca. 1.6 mya; fire, Swartkrans (South Africa)
 - First hominin to leave Africa
    adapted to a number of environments, e.g. Europe; SE Asia by 1.8 mya!
 - How did they leave Africa?
    Sahara Pump Theory
     - desertification during the Pleistocene created a land bridge between NE Africa and the Levant
     - H. erectus may have followed herbivores (e.g., hippo, elephant) and carnivores (e.g., lion, leopard, hyena) across the Arabian peninsula

Homo erectus... in Europe
 - Dmanisi, Georgia
    dated to 1.8 mya (earliest outside of Africa)
    five Homo erectus skulls found in cave site
    Skull 5 (D4500), found in 2005, most complete
     - cranial capacity: 546 cc (small, like Australopithecus) but other cranial features resemble erectus
 - In addition to these five skulls there is a number of tools(choppers and flakes)

Homo erectus... in Asia
 - Trinil area of Java (Java man)
 - 1.8 mya - 600,000 years ago
 - Zhoukoudian, China
    Limestone quarry; cave
    Datedto between 500,000 - 200,000 BP
    numerous specimens found in association with tools and animal bones; poss. carnivore activity
 - Gradual increase in cranial capacity
    900cc at 600,000 ya; 1100cc by 200,000 ya


General Anatomical Trends
 - Post-cranial skeleton essentially fully modern; cranial developments...
    endocranial volume: 800-1100 cc
    pronounced brow ridges
    decreased prognathiusm (orthognathous face)
    smaller teeth
    movement of foramen magnum


Lifeways
 - Regional economies and toolkits (Africa/Europe vs. SE Asia)
 - Varied in connection with:
    biodiversity
    availability of tool-making materials


Technology
 - Increased refinement and diversity through time
 - Earliest wooden artifacts at Schoningen in Germany, 400 kya
 - Oldowan technology gives way to Acheulian by 1.5 mya


The Acheulian Tradition
 - 1.5 mya to ca. 60,000 BP (still Lower Paleolithic)
 - Africa, Western Europe and SW Asia
 - Choppers, flake tools, cleavers and hand axes
    regional variability

Acheulian Handaxe
 - chipped stone tool 7-30 cm in length, 2+ kg
 - Prepared core technology
    evidence of skill (knapping techniques)
 - Symmetry around long axis
 - Bifacially worked, multipurpose tools
    woodworking, scraping skins, butchery
    recyclable into other tools


Evolution of the Mind?
 - Increase in cognitive faculties suggested by:
    Design 'template', e.g. symmetry
    Sense of proportion
    Understanding of fracture mechanics
    Use of multiple fabricators
    Rotation of objective piece
    Standardization (in some areas)


Increased Diversity
 - Acheulian hand axes
    variable morphology in most areas
 - Cleavers
 - Bamboo tools (SE Asia)


Hunting Practices
 - More sophisticated
    required co-ordination and co-operation
 - Reflect an increase in social organization
