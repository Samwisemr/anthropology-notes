Indicators - Writing

 - 'symbols' - present since Upper Paleolithic times
 - most early writing involves combinations of:
    pictographs

 - later developments involve:
    syllabic / alphabetic writing
 - logographic / ideographic
    Abstract, formal correspondence between depiction and word
     - One written symbol for each word or phrase in vocabulary
    Characters stand for meanings, not sounds
 - Syllabic / Alphabetic
    Syllabic - written symbol for each syllable
     - examples: cuneiform and hieroglyphics use a combination of logographs and syllabics
