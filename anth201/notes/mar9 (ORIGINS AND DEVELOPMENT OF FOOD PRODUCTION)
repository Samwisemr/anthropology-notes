After the Pleistocene

 - geological epoch known as the Holocene
 - after 11000 BP, we see the following climatic / environmental changes:
    temperatures, humidity increase
    glaciers retreat / sea levels rise
    some plant and animal species disappear (e.g., megafauna in the Americas, Australia and Eurasia)
 - many groups adapted by broadengin their resource bases
    e.g., Mesolithic groups in Europe, Near East; Archaic groups in NA
 - increased use of fish, shellfish, small mammals, seeds, and nuts
 - later, people began to intensify their exploitation of certain resources
    e.g., 10,000 BP in the Near East (SW Asia)
    e.g., 9,000 BP in Mesoamerica
 - result: some population increases, greater degrees of sedentism
 - soon, groups began selectively exploiting some plant and animal species
 - this marks the transition from food collection to food production
    food production = Neolithic way of life


Origins and Consequences of Food Production

 - What is Food Production?
    systematic interference with growth of a food supply
    increase in energy, but in some cases less land
 - Two interactive processes (consequences)
    changes in plant and animal physiology
    changes in human lifeways
 - Systematic interference in plants...
    seeds become larger
    higher yield per unit area
    loss of natural seed-dispersal mechanisms; tougher rachis in wheat, barley and corn
    crop harvested more successfully
 - Definitions: Horticulture, Agriculture and Pastoralism
    Dependence on cultivation and/or animal husbandry for a majority of diet
 - Horticulture
    cultivation of plants with simple (hand) tools
    minimal interference with land and water
    minimal animal husbandry
 - Agriculture
    draft animals
    fertilization
    irrigation
 - Pastoralism
    dependence of animal husbandry for survival
 - changes in human lifeways (material)
    harvesting - new tools
    processing - new tools
    storage - 'container revolution'
     - stockpiling of food for leaner months
 - changes in human iifeways (social)
    organization of labour
    leadership and co-ordination
    sedentism - differential access to resources
    villages - political and economic autonomy
 - important: no 'one person' invented agriculture
 - complicated set of precesses
 - subject of numerous theories / models
 - environmental change:
    Oasis Model (Childe 1928)
    increased aridity in SW Asia at close of Pleistocene
    humans and animals sought out 'oases' where plants thrived
     - humans 'naturally' tended to these resources
    Braidwood (1973) sought to test model
 - Increased Specialization:
    Nuclear Zone of 'Hilly Flanks' model
    Braidwood (1948)
    
    riparian (floodplain) and upland areas home to wild ancestors of domesticates, not lowland 'oases'
    groups became proficient at exploiting these resources
     - began to experiment and manipulate plants / animals
 - Sedentism and Pop. increase:
    Marginal Zone Model
    (Binford 1971; Flannery 1971)

    groups pushed to marginal areas due to pop. pressure will experiment with domestication
    essentially a resource stress model
 - Social pressure to Generate Surpluses
    (Bender 1978)

    changes in social systems required more intensive production
    needed to fulfill social and political obligations (e.g., paying of tribute)
