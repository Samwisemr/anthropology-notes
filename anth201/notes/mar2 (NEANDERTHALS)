Archaic Homo Sapiens

 - Evolved out of H. erectus in Africa, Europe, and Asia, ca. 600-130 kya
 - Several (general) anatomical advances
    larger brain capacity (~1200cc)
    steeper foreheads; rear of cranium more rounded
    less robust
    more orthognathous faces; smaller molar teeth
 - Distinguished from Homo sapiens sapiens by:
    thicker, wider skull
    lack of defined chin
    prominent brow ridges
 - these trends evident at Kabwe (aka Broken Hill 1) in Zambia
    found in mine, 1921
    cranium + several post-cranial elements
    ca. 300-125 kya
    cranial capacity: 1280cc
    robust; note pronounced brow ridges
 - these trends are also found in Europe and East Asia
 - European specimens appear somehwat more 'robust' than those from Asia (polytypic differences)
    trend toward 'classic' Neanderthal form
    in Europe, AHS considered antecedents of Neanderthals (aka Homo heidelbergensis)
 - Evident at site of "Sima de los Huesos" (Pit of Bones) or Atapuerca, in Spain
    cave site, ca. 350-300 kya
    28 skeletons
    intentional burials or natural processes?


Neanderthals
 - Emerge ca. 130 kya; last until roughly 30 kya
 - Flourished in Europe (particularly western Europe) and SW Asia
    differences (between Neanderthals and AMHs) less pronounced around eastern Mediterranean
 - Anatomical Features
    heavily-muscled overall e.g., bowing in ulna/radius and femur
    wide and broad; stood roughly 150cm / 5ft tall
     - adaptation to cold
 - endocranial volume: 1300-1600 cc
 - Anatomical Features
    relatively short forearms
    broad hands and feet
    bun-shaped skull (rounded, low in profile + occipital ...)


Neanderthal DNA
 - Neanderthal mtDNA extracted and compared to 994 modern human lineages
 - Hypervariable region 1 (of DNA) shows generational change
    more dissimilar = more distant the relation
 - In hypervariable region 1 (of DNA) difference in 27 or 28 'base pairs'
    difference among modern human lineages
     - ~8 base pairs
    difference between humans and chimps
     - 55 base pairs
 - If humans and chimps diverged ca. 4-5 mya, humans diverged from Neanderthals between ca. 550-690 kya
 - Suggests Neanderthals were a 'side-branch' of human evolution
    we did not descend from them (we replaced them)
    ...but did we interbreed with them?


Neanderthal-Human Interbreeding
 - Neanderthal Genome Project
    Svante Paabo, Max Planck Evolutionary Institute
 - Sequenced 3.2 billion base pairs
 - Findings (published in Science, May 2010)
    genetic contribution to non-African modern humans ranges from 1% to 4%
 - so, there likely was interbreeding (though still considered contentious)
 - Interbreeding likely took place in SW Asia (Levant) before Homo sapiens migrated to Europe


Neanderthal Tool Technology: The Mousterian
 - Associated with the Middle Paleolithic
 - Name given to stone tool technology associated with the Neanderthals of Eurasia between 100 and 30 kya
 - Named after a prominent site in SW France (Le Moustier)
 - Flake-based technology (retouched flakes) though formal tools are also found
 - Also, evidence of composite tools (tools with more than one component, e.g., point, shaft, and binding for spear)
 - A hallmark of the Mousterian is use of the Levallois technique (a prepared core technology)
 - Involves carefully preparing the core so as to outline the finished tool before it is actually detached
 - Requires skill and planning


Neanderthal Burial Practices
 - Evidence of intentional burial / altruism
 - e.g. La Ferrassie, France (ca. 38,000 BP)
    cave site in the Dordogne region
    burial locale containing 8 individuals (2 adults, 6 children)
     - evidence of group cohesion, territoriality?
    La Ferrassie 1 - 40-55 ya male with osteoarthritis, infections
     - altruism?
 - e.g., Shanidar Cave, NE Iraq
    ten individuals (Shanidar I through X) dated to ca. 35-65 kya + 100s of Mousterian tools
    Shanidar 1 - 'Nandy'
     - male 40-55 years old; suffered from numerous peri-mortem fractures, nerve damage
    Shanidar IV - 'the flower burial'
     - pollen from 8 flower species covered / cushioned body of 30-45 year old male

Shanidar I - 'Nandy'
 - crushing fracture around left eye
 - right side of body shows injury; right arm ceased to grow
 - right foot broken
 - likely nerve damage - rendered him weak or immobile
 - injuries healed prior to death
