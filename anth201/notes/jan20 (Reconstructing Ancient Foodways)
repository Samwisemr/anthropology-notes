Reconstructing Ancient Foodways

Faunal Remains
 - Zooarchaeology/Archaeozoology
	The study of faunal remains found in archaeological contexts
	Typically used to reconstruct cultural practices(i.e. subsistence-settle	ment)
 - Animal Taxonomy
	A critical tool in faunal identification is the reference collection
	 - Collection of modern skeletal elements, teeth, shell, and horn or ant	   ler from reliably identified specimens of known species, age and sex
 - Taphonomy
	The study of the processes which affect the remains of organism after de	  ath(n-transforms)
	These processes destroy some kinds of tissue more easily than others(e.g	  . skin and cartilage


Analysis of Faunal Remains
 - Age at Death(kill patterns)
	Fusion of the epiphyses to the diaphysis
 - Teeth - dental eruption
	Replaced on a schedule that is known in modern animals
 - Teeth - wear
	Young animals should show very little wear on occlusal(biting) surfaces

 - These measurements can lead to the identification of distinctive age profiles
 - Attritional Age Profile
	Young and old are disproportionately represented; typically signifies se	  lective hunting, scavenging
 - Seasonality
	Measurements used to determine when a site was formed and used
	  Shed antler by cervids
	  Presence of migratory birds
 - Domestication
	Measurement used to determine shift from hunting and gathering to herdin	  g and agriculture
	 - Changes in the size and crowding of teeth, loss of horns or change in 	  their shape among sheep
	 - Evidence of animal tethering
 - Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis
	Principally used to measure the isotopic ratios of carbon atoms in bones 	  and teeth
	These isotopes are stable, unlike ^14C which decays at a known rate
	Ratio of ^12C to ^13C affected by the photosynthetic pathways of Cs3 vs 	  Cs4 plants
	 - These plants leave distinct dietary signals in teeth and bone during 	  formation
	Change in dietary isotopic rations = dietary shift


Reconstructing Paleodiet -- Cs3 and Cs4 Plants
 - Cs3 and Cs4 plants fix carbon along different photosynthetic pathways
	Southern Ontario is a Cs3 biome


Why is this so interesting?
 - Hunters and gatherers are not supposed to resemble/behave like food producers
 - Food production signals important shifts in human lifeways
