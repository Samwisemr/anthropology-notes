Field Methods - Survey
 - Surface survey: walking or testpitting; can be systematic or purposive
 - Aerial survey
 - Remote sensing
	Resistivity
	Magnetometry
	Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
	Satellite imagery
 - Many sites are found by accident

 - Mapping
    - Regional, local, and site-level mapping
	Remote sensing can also be used for site mapping
	GPS can be used to map the location of sites
    - Surface Collection
    - Cartesian coordinates (x and y)

 - Surface Collection
    - The spatial distribution of artifacts of the surface of a site is recorded      with reference to a fixed point(datum)
    - This data can be recorded using a THEODOLITE, TOTAL STATION, or even a com      pass and tape
    - Theodolite: instrument with telescope used to measure horizontal and verti      cal angles
    - Total Station: essentially a theodolite with a built-in electronic distanc      e meter (EDM)
