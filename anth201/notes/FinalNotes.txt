================      feb24 (HUMAN ORIGINS)      ===================



Hominin (Hominid)
 - Primates of the family Hominidae
 - Includes modern humans, earlier human subspecies and their direct ancestors
    essentially, all species that emerged after the Pan-Homo divergence ca. 7 mya
 - Typically identified by bipedal adaptations

Bidpedalism
 - Upright posture and gait; opposed to quadrupedalism or knuckle-walking
 - Adaptation to tropical (savanna) environments
    Increase in time spent on the ground
    Long-distance travel; endurance
 - Occurs sometime after 10 mya; certainly by 4 mya


                                Primates
                                    |
                    antropoids <----------> Prosimians
                        |-----|
                       apes   |---> monkeys
                        |
                    Hominins
                        | 
     Sahelanthropus <---|---> Ardipithecus
                        |
    Australopithecus <------> Homo



Sahelanthropus tchadensis
 - aka "Toumai" - mostly complete cranium
 - Discovered in west-central Chad, 2001
 - Estimated Age - 7 to 6 mya (probably closer to 7 mya)
 - Small brain (320-380 cubic centimetres(cc) ); comparable to chimpanzees
 - Occipital (back) of cranium looks like chimpanzee
 - Frontal (facial structure and dental arcade) - more like Australopithecine ca. 1.75 mya
 - No post-cranial fragments
    Bipedalism suggested by the anterior (as opposed to posterior) position of the foramen magnum
 - Could be ancestor of Ardipithecus

Australopithecus afarensis
 - Likely emerged ca. 4 mya in East Africa
 - Best known specimen - "Lucy"; remarkably complete
 - Discovered by Donald Johanson in 1974, Afar region of Ethiopia
 - Dated to ca. 3.2 mya
 - Height: 1.2 m (4 ft); Female, 19-21 years old
 - Would have been powerful with a stocky, muscular build
 - Fully bipedal
 - Curved arms and fingers associated with earlier tree climbers
 - Other notable finds:
    Footprints in volcanic ash at Laetoli in Tanzania by Mary Leakey in 1978
    Dated to 3.6 mya
    Confirms bipedalism in A. afarensis
    Notably... bipedalism predates tool making and large cranial capacity

Split
 - ca. 3 mya, the descendents of A. afarensis split into two distinct lines
    Gracile Line - A. africanus, A. garhi
     - A. Africanus found in South Africa; A. garhi in East Africa
    Robust Line - A. robustus, A. boisei,
     - Found in both South Africa and East Africa
 - There are likely other (as yet unidentified) lines

Australopithecus garhi
 - Discovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, 1996
 - Dated to ca. 2 mya
 - Height: 1.46 m (4ft 10in); "chimp-like" prognathism; cranial capacity ~400-500 cc
 - May have been the first to butcher animals
    if so, A. garhi would be the earliest tool user

Robust Australopithecines
 - South Africa - A. robustus fossils first found at Swartkrans by Robert Broom in 1948
 - East Africa - A. bosei fossils found by Mary Leakey in the Olduvai Gorge region of Tanzania in 1959
 - Dated to between 3 and 1 mya
 - Heavily-built, with small brains (~ 500 cc) and large teeth
    consistent with a diet based on fibrous plant foods
 - Sagittal crest indicates string jaw muscles
    present in large apes, but not in A. Africanus or Homo

Adaptive Radiation
 - Theory used to understand how hominin species can overlap in the fossil record
 - Refers to the diversification of a species as it adapts to different ecological niches
    First radiation: bipdal apes which lived in the more arid regions of Africa
    Two later radiations (presumably out of A. afarensis ca. 3 mya) gave rise to the robust line of Australopithecines and early Homo

Homo habilis
 - "Handy person" - assumed tool-making abilities
 - First discovered by Louis and Mary Leakey in Bed 1 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in 1960
 - Decrease in prognathism; higher, rounder cranium
 - Increase in cranial capacity: 600-700 cc
    Thought to correlate with capacity to make stone tools, better exploit landscape
 - Omnivorous
 - Biped, but retained ability to climb trees
    Similar lengths in humeri/femora
    Similar to chimpanzees, but not like us
 - H. habilis may have spent a great deal of time in wooded environments

Overall Biological Trends
 - Influenced by shift in the mode of locomotion from quadrupedalism to bipedalism
 - Major changes:
    Increased cranial capacity
    Decreased prognathism
    Shape of Pelvis
     - Shortened and broadened illium (section of pelvic girdle above hip socket)
     - Provides for complex muscle attachments needed to maintain balance while walking
 - Foramen Magnum
    Back of cranium - quadrupedal locomotion (e.g. apes)
    Closer to face - bipedal locomotion (e.g. humans)
     - cranium of humans is balanced on top of the spinal column
 - Dental Arcade
    Tied to decrease in prognathism
    Chimpanzees have a narrow, U-shaped arcade with elongated canines
    A. Afarensis has an intermediate V-shaped arcade
    Modern humans have a wider, parabolic arcade

Origins of Human Culture
 - We see with Homo habilis, for the first time, evidence of learned behaviour in the form of:
    Tool Use (the Oldowan Tool Tradition)
    Subsistence / Settlement practices (home bases)
    Social Organization

Early Tool Use: The Oldowan
 - Earliest (?) "human" technology - the Oldowan
    Beginning of the Lower Paleolithic Period
 - Simple tools; East Africa (Olduvai Gorge), ca. 2.5 mya
    Coincides with the emergence of H. habilis
 - Consists of large pebble choppers with flakes removed at one end
    Flakes could have been used for a variety of tasks






--------------------------------------------------------



================      feb29 (HOMO ERECTUS)      ===================



Homo erectus
 - Transition to more advanced hominin forms, i.e., H. ergaster (?) and H. erectus ca. 1.9 mya
    ca. 1.5 mya: 5 or 6 extant hominin species
    ca. 1 mya: onlly H. ergaster and H. erectus
 - Transition coincides, roughly with the start of the Pleistocene


The Pleistocene
 - Geological 'epoch' or time period
    aka the Ice Age; ca. 2.6 mya - 12,000 BP
 - Characterized by cyclical cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) climatic conditions
 - During glacial maxima, 30% of the earth's surface covered by ice sheets
 - On the ice sheets:
    Several kilometres thick
     - Major geomorphological consequences
    Huge volume of water tied up
     - Sea level drops in the order of 100-200 metres
     - Consequence: littoral sites now submerged
     - Consequence: less rainfall, desserts drier & more expansive


Homo erectus
 - Likely evolved from H. habilis
    trasitional specimens yet to be documented
 - Some consider 'African' sp. to be H. ergaster
 - Earliest forms come from East Africa
    ca. 1.8 mya, Lake Turkana, northern Kenya
 - Anatomical traits (crania)
    heavy brow ridges (supraorbital torus)
    larger, more orthognathous face (compared to H. habilis)
    high forehead (compared to Australopithecines)
    long, low braincase; approx. 700-900 cc
 - Anatomical traits (post-crania)
    shorter arms, longer legs (terrestrial existence)
 - Emerged out of (same as?) H. ergaster
    European/East Asian form; subject of debate
 - Earliest specimens found in East Africa
    ca. 1.9 mya - 200,000 BP
    ca. 1.6 mya; fire, Swartkrans (South Africa)
 - First hominin to leave Africa
    adapted to a number of environments, e.g. Europe; SE Asia by 1.8 mya!
 - How did they leave Africa?
    Sahara Pump Theory
     - desertification during the Pleistocene created a land bridge between NE Africa and the Levant
     - H. erectus may have followed herbivores (e.g., hippo, elephant) and carnivores (e.g., lion, leopard, hyena) across the Arabian peninsula

Homo erectus... in Europe
 - Dmanisi, Georgia
    dated to 1.8 mya (earliest outside of Africa)
    five Homo erectus skulls found in cave site
    Skull 5 (D4500), found in 2005, most complete
     - cranial capacity: 546 cc (small, like Australopithecus) but other cranial features resemble erectus
 - In addition to these five skulls there is a number of tools(choppers and flakes)

Homo erectus... in Asia
 - Trinil area of Java (Java man)
 - 1.8 mya - 600,000 years ago
 - Zhoukoudian, China
    Limestone quarry; cave
    Datedto between 500,000 - 200,000 BP
    numerous specimens found in association with tools and animal bones; poss. carnivore activity
 - Gradual increase in cranial capacity
    900cc at 600,000 ya; 1100cc by 200,000 ya


General Anatomical Trends
 - Post-cranial skeleton essentially fully modern; cranial developments...
    endocranial volume: 800-1100 cc
    pronounced brow ridges
    decreased prognathiusm (orthognathous face)
    smaller teeth
    movement of foramen magnum


Lifeways
 - Regional economies and toolkits (Africa/Europe vs. SE Asia)
 - Varied in connection with:
    biodiversity
    availability of tool-making materials


Technology
 - Increased refinement and diversity through time
 - Earliest wooden artifacts at Schoningen in Germany, 400 kya
 - Oldowan technology gives way to Acheulian by 1.5 mya


The Acheulian Tradition
 - 1.5 mya to ca. 60,000 BP (still Lower Paleolithic)
 - Africa, Western Europe and SW Asia
 - Choppers, flake tools, cleavers and hand axes
    regional variability

Acheulian Handaxe
 - chipped stone tool 7-30 cm in length, 2+ kg
 - Prepared core technology
    evidence of skill (knapping techniques)
 - Symmetry around long axis
 - Bifacially worked, multipurpose tools
    woodworking, scraping skins, butchery
    recyclable into other tools


Evolution of the Mind?
 - Increase in cognitive faculties suggested by:
    Design 'template', e.g. symmetry
    Sense of proportion
    Understanding of fracture mechanics
    Use of multiple fabricators
    Rotation of objective piece
    Standardization (in some areas)


Increased Diversity
 - Acheulian hand axes
    variable morphology in most areas
 - Cleavers
 - Bamboo tools (SE Asia)


Hunting Practices
 - More sophisticated
    required co-ordination and co-operation
 - Reflect an increase in social organization
 - Evidence
    Boxgrove, UK
    Ambrona and Torralba, Spain






--------------------------------------------------------



================      mar2 (NEANDERTHALS)      ===================



Archaic Homo Sapiens

 - Evolved out of H. erectus in Africa, Europe, and Asia, ca. 600-130 kya
 - Several (general) anatomical advances
    larger brain capacity (~1200cc)
    steeper foreheads; rear of cranium more rounded
    less robust
    more orthognathous faces; smaller molar teeth
 - Distinguished from Homo sapiens sapiens by:
    thicker, wider skull
    lack of defined chin
    prominent brow ridges
 - these trends evident at Kabwe (aka Broken Hill 1) in Zambia
    found in mine, 1921
    cranium + several post-cranial elements
    ca. 300-125 kya
    cranial capacity: 1280cc
    robust; note pronounced brow ridges
 - these trends are also found in Europe and East Asia
 - European specimens appear somehwat more 'robust' than those from Asia (polytypic differences)
    trend toward 'classic' Neanderthal form
    in Europe, AHS considered antecedents of Neanderthals (aka Homo heidelbergensis)
 - Evident at site of "Sima de los Huesos" (Pit of Bones) or Atapuerca, in Spain
    cave site, ca. 350-300 kya
    28 skeletons
    intentional burials or natural processes?


Neanderthals
 - Emerge ca. 130 kya; last until roughly 30 kya
 - Flourished in Europe (particularly western Europe) and SW Asia
    differences (between Neanderthals and AMHs) less pronounced around eastern Mediterranean
 - Anatomical Features
    heavily-muscled overall e.g., bowing in ulna/radius and femur
    wide and broad; stood roughly 150cm / 5ft tall
     - adaptation to cold
 - endocranial volume: 1300-1600 cc
 - Anatomical Features
    relatively short forearms
    broad hands and feet
    bun-shaped skull (rounded, low in profile + occipital ...)


Neanderthal DNA
 - Neanderthal mtDNA extracted and compared to 994 modern human lineages
 - Hypervariable region 1 (of DNA) shows generational change
    more dissimilar = more distant the relation
 - In hypervariable region 1 (of DNA) difference in 27 or 28 'base pairs'
    difference among modern human lineages
     - ~8 base pairs
    difference between humans and chimps
     - 55 base pairs
 - If humans and chimps diverged ca. 4-5 mya, humans diverged from Neanderthals between ca. 550-690 kya
 - Suggests Neanderthals were a 'side-branch' of human evolution
    we did not descend from them (we replaced them)
    ...but did we interbreed with them?


Neanderthal-Human Interbreeding
 - Neanderthal Genome Project
    Svante Paabo, Max Planck Evolutionary Institute
 - Sequenced 3.2 billion base pairs
 - Findings (published in Science, May 2010)
    genetic contribution to non-African modern humans ranges from 1% to 4%
 - so, there likely was interbreeding (though still considered contentious)
 - Interbreeding likely took place in SW Asia (Levant) before Homo sapiens migrated to Europe


Neanderthal Tool Technology: The Mousterian
 - Associated with the Middle Paleolithic
 - Name given to stone tool technology associated with the Neanderthals of Eurasia between 100 and 30 kya
 - Named after a prominent site in SW France (Le Moustier)
 - Flake-based technology (retouched flakes) though formal tools are also found
 - Also, evidence of composite tools (tools with more than one component, e.g., point, shaft, and binding for spear)
 - A hallmark of the Mousterian is use of the Levallois technique (a prepared core technology)
 - Involves carefully preparing the core so as to outline the finished tool before it is actually detached
 - Requires skill and planning


Neanderthal Burial Practices
 - Evidence of intentional burial / altruism
 - e.g. La Ferrassie, France (ca. 38,000 BP)
    cave site in the Dordogne region
    burial locale containing 8 individuals (2 adults, 6 children)
     - evidence of group cohesion, territoriality?
    La Ferrassie 1 - 40-55 ya male with osteoarthritis, infections
     - altruism?
 - e.g., Shanidar Cave, NE Iraq
    ten individuals (Shanidar I through X) dated to ca. 35-65 kya + 100s of Mousterian tools
    Shanidar 1 - 'Nandy'
     - male 40-55 years old; suffered from numerous peri-mortem fractures, nerve damage
    Shanidar IV - 'the flower burial'
     - pollen from 8 flower species covered / cushioned body of 30-45 year old male

Shanidar I - 'Nandy'
 - crushing fracture around left eye
 - right side of body shows injury; right arm ceased to grow
 - right foot broken
 - likely nerve damage - rendered him weak or immobile
 - injuries healed prior to death







--------------------------------------------------------



================      mar7 (AMH Migration etc...)      ===================



Origins

 - AMH emerge between 200 and 100 kya and are found in:
    SW Asia by ca. 130 kya
    East Asia by ca. 110 kya
    Europe and Australia by ca. 45 kya
    the Americas by 15 kya
 - Some debate re: evolutionary mechanism - continuity or replacement?
 - Evidence argues against the multiregional model
    earliest fossil remains come from Africa: Omo (195 kya) and Herto (160 kya), both in Ethiopia
    forms intermediate between AHS and AMH found only in Africa
    arch. evidence for contemporaneity between AHS and AMH
    locally derived, regionally specific anatomical traits are of recent origin
 - mtDNA evidenc ealso argues against the multiregional model
    modern humans derive from a 200 kya African population (little to no interbreeding with AHS)
    remember: 8 base pair differences among extant pops., 27-28 base pair differences between Neanderthals and AMH
 - despite this, debate is ongoing


Early AMHs in Africa

 - Homo sapiens idaltu
 - fossil evidence: Herto (Ethiopia)
    three skulls, ca. 160 kya
 - crania: longer, more rugged;
    volume ~1450 cc
 - suggests development of AMH complete in Africa by 160 kya, far earlier than anywhere else


AMH Cultural Development

 - new tool kits based on antler, bone, and wood + parallel-sided stone blade technology
    pre-shaped core
    indiret percussion / punch technique
    pressure flaking / retouch
 - blade technology (e.g. Aurignacian in Europe, well developed by 30 kya)
 - blades (specialized flakes)
    longer than wide
    parallel sides
    increased efficiency
    decreased waste
 - fossil evidence for 'complex cognition': Blombos Cave (South Africa)
    extensive occupational deposits ca. 65 kya
    numerous blade tools, spear points, and possible bone points
    wide array of resources consumed: plant foods, fish, shellfish, small mammals
    earlier occupation at 75 kya has perforated shell items (ornaments) and engraved ochre
 - sites like Blombos Cave suggest greater cognitive development
    Steven Mithen (1996) - cognitive fluidity
     - previously isolated mental domains (environmental, technical, social, etc.) become more fully integrated in AMHs
     - accordingly, cognition becomes more advanced (e.g., abstract, metaphorical) and more 'fluid'
 - competitive edge over extant populations


Colonization: Australia

 - colonization of Australia by at least 40 kya
 - use of watercraft, but...
 - exposed continental shelves (now submerged) connected many offshore islands to the Asian mainland
 - Archaeological evidence: Willandra Lakes Region (SE Australia, NSW)
    earliest evidence for cremation
     - ('Mungo Lady') ca. 40 kya
    nearby ochre burial of 'Mungo Man'
     - also ca. 40 kya
    stone tools dated to ca. 46-50 kya


AMH in Europe

 - Upper Paleolithic Period
 - first AMH found in SW France in the Dordogne region (home of many Neanderthal finds)
 - anatomically indistinguishable from ourselves, but different from Neanderthals
 - settled in SE and Central Europe by 40 kya; SW France by 35 kya


AMH Tool Technology

 - advancements
    careful selection of fine-grained toolstones
    production of standardized parallel-sided blades / refinement of knapping techniques
    refinement of the burin (chisel) - enabled detailed work on antler and bone
    groove and splinter technique - enabled production of bone spear points and harpoons
 - also developed the atalal or spearthrower
 - microliths: used all over Uerasia; first appear in SE Asia (China) ~30 kya, in use oelsewhere by 25 to 20 kya
 - distinctive hafted artifacts manufactured on microblades
 - served as spear barbs, arrow points, small knives and scrapers


AMH in Eurasia

 - after 18 kya, increase in movement to the open steppe and tundra plains of northern Eurasia
    concentrations in river valleys
 - archaeological evidence - Mezhirich (Ukraine)
    complex of 4 dome-shaped houses made from mammoth skulls, jaws and limb bones, 5 m across
     - hides and sod used as covering
     - subterranean entranceways
 - mammoth bone with inscribed 'map' of region
 - site dated to 17 kya


The First Americans

 - some debate as to when people first arrived in the Americas
 - could be as early as 30 kya; likely ca. 15 kya
 - Beringia (landmass linking NE Asia with Alaska)
    now the Bering Sea
 - tracking migrating herds of caribou?
 - ca. 15 kya, much of northern North America covered by ice sheets (blocked access to south)
 - after 14 kya, sheets melted rapidly which would have allowed passage
 - earliest site, oddly, is in Chile (Monte Verde)
 - Monte Verde (Chile)
    definitely occupied by 14 kya; possibly as early as 31 kya
    good preservation of bone and wooden artifacts
    evidence for plant foods (e.g., potato)
    mastadon and camel remains also found; exploited small game







--------------------------------------------------------



================      mar9 (ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION)      ===================



After the Pleistocene

 - geological epoch known as the Holocene
 - after 11000 BP, we see the following climatic / environmental changes:
    temperatures, humidity increase
    glaciers retreat / sea levels rise
    some plant and animal species disappear (e.g., megafauna in the Americas, Australia and Eurasia)
 - many groups adapted by broadengin their resource bases
    e.g., Mesolithic groups in Europe, Near East; Archaic groups in NA
 - increased use of fish, shellfish, small mammals, seeds, and nuts
 - later, people began to intensify their exploitation of certain resources
    e.g., 10,000 BP in the Near East (SW Asia)
    e.g., 9,000 BP in Mesoamerica
 - result: some population increases, greater degrees of sedentism
 - soon, groups began selectively exploiting some plant and animal species
 - this marks the transition from food collection to food production
    food production = Neolithic way of life


Origins and Consequences of Food Production

 - What is Food Production?
    systematic interference with growth of a food supply
    increase in energy, but in some cases less land
 - Two interactive processes (consequences)
    changes in plant and animal physiology
    changes in human lifeways
 - Systematic interference in plants...
    seeds become larger
    higher yield per unit area
    loss of natural seed-dispersal mechanisms; tougher rachis in wheat, barley and corn
    crop harvested more successfully
 - Definitions: Horticulture, Agriculture and Pastoralism
    Dependence on cultivation and/or animal husbandry for a majority of diet
 - Horticulture
    cultivation of plants with simple (hand) tools
    minimal interference with land and water
    minimal animal husbandry
 - Agriculture
    draft animals
    fertilization
    irrigation
 - Pastoralism
    dependence of animal husbandry for survival
 - changes in human lifeways (material)
    harvesting - new tools
    processing - new tools
    storage - 'container revolution'
     - stockpiling of food for leaner months
 - changes in human iifeways (social)
    organization of labour
    leadership and co-ordination
    sedentism - differential access to resources
    villages - political and economic autonomy
 - important: no 'one person' invented agriculture
 - complicated set of precesses
 - subject of numerous theories / models
 - environmental change:
    Oasis Model (Childe 1928)
    increased aridity in SW Asia at close of Pleistocene
    humans and animals sought out 'oases' where plants thrived
     - humans 'naturally' tended to these resources
    Braidwood (1973) sought to test model
 - Increased Specialization:
    Nuclear Zone of 'Hilly Flanks' model
    Braidwood (1948)
    
    riparian (floodplain) and upland areas home to wild ancestors of domesticates, not lowland 'oases'
    groups became proficient at exploiting these resources
     - began to experiment and manipulate plants / animals
 - Sedentism and Pop. increase:
    Marginal Zone Model
    (Binford 1971; Flannery 1971)

    groups pushed to marginal areas due to pop. pressure will experiment with domestication
    essentially a resource stress model
 - Social pressure to Generate Surpluses
    (Bender 1978)

    changes in social systems required more intensive production
    needed to fulfill social and political obligations (e.g., paying of tribute)







--------------------------------------------------------



================      mar14 (ANCIENT NORTH AMERICA)      ===================



Recall

 - Colonization of NA after 15 kya
    earliest groups known as Paleoindians
 - ca. 10 kya in NA: broad spectrum economies
    'Archaic Period' populations
    h&g; small mammals, fish, seeds and nuts


ENA - Introduction

 - Major periods in ENA archaeology
    Paleoindian 10,000 - 8000 BC
    Archaic 8,000 - 2000 BC
    Early Woodland 2000 BC - AD 1
    Middle Woodland AD 1 - 500
    Late Woodland (NE) AD 500 - contact
    Mississippian (SE) AD 500 - contact


Early Woodland

 - After 2000 BC, we see the following developments in ENA
    Increased sedentism / decreased mobility
    Increased reliance on plant foods (Midwest)
    Pottery
    Increased social complexity
    More elaborate burial mound construction
    More elaborate inter-regional exchange


Eastern Agricultural Complex

 - Plants in the EAC include squash and gourd, sunflower, marsh elder, and goosefoot
    all had edible seeds, either oily (sunflower, marsh elder) or starchy (goosefoot, maygrass knotweed, little barley)
 - most EAC plants thrive in open, disturbed habitats like river floodplains (occupied by humans since Early Archaic)
 - Wild rice also likely an important resource in many areas


Adena and Hopewell

 - Between 500 BC and AD 400, Adena and Hopewell groups:
    Built extensive earthworks including mounds
    Had mortuary rituals involving the use of charnel houses and log-lined tombs
    Manufactured elaborately-carved pipes, birdstones (atlatl weights)
 - After AD 1, Hopewell groups:
    participated in more elaborate inter-regional exchange
     - Hopewell Interaction Sphere
    developed a distinctive religious iconography / ideology
    Began to cultivate maize (after ca. AD 200)


The Mississippian Tradition

 - Between AD 500 and European contact, we see the following developments in the Midwest and SE
    Collapse of Hopewell and the HIS
    Intensification of food production (maize horticulture)
    Chiefdom level of social organization (Mississipian Tradition) with six regional variants
 - Between AD 900 and 1300, we see the:
    Emergence and decline of 'towns'
     - e.g., Cahokia, Moundville
    Construction of platform mounds
    Southeastern Ceremonial Cult iconography and ideology


Cahokia

 - Monk's Mound: four terraces, 5.6 ha, 30 m high
    more than twice the size of any other mound at Cahokia; focal point for community (region?)
 - Once supported series of structures (inc. chief's house)
 - immense plaza immediately to the south






--------------------------------------------------------



================      mar16 (Origins and Development of Complex Society)      ===================



What is Complex Society?

According to Chile (1951), Flannery (1972) and others, complex societies are characterized by suite of archaeological indicators, including:
    Writing
    Metallurgy
    Predictive sciences
    Large population
    Social stratification
    Occupational specialization
    Monumental architecture and works


Indicators - Writing

 - 'symbols' - present since Upper Paleolithic times
 - most early writing involves combinations of:
    pictographs
    logographs / ideographs
 - later developments involve:
    syllabic / alphabetic writing
 - logographic / ideographic
    Abstract, formal correspondence between depiction and word
     - One written symbol for each word or phrase in vocabulary
    Characters stand for meanings, not sounds
 - Syllabic / Alphabetic
    Syllabic - written symbol for each syllable
     - examples: cuneiform and hieroglyphics use a combination of logographs and syllabics
    Alphabetic - written symbol for each vowel and consonant
     - greek alphabet
     - roman alphabet

================      mar21 (Complex Society in SW Asia and Egypt)      ===================



Mesopotamia

 - alluvial plain around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
 - encompasses much of modern-day Iraq and Syria


Environmental Context

 - low rainfall: water comes mainly from Tigris and Euphrates
 - dramatic spring floods: silt (chokes canals)
 - plain is flat & poorly drained: salinization (salt build-up)
 - wheat, barley, lentils
 - sheep, goats, cattle


Early Settlement

 - plain settled during the Formative Period (5500 - 4500 BC) by 'Ubaid culture
    farming settlements of 2-10 ha; 2 tier settlement hierarchy (villages, towns) by 4000 BC
    rectangular, mud brick homes; growth around temples
    extensive irrigation, development of potter's wheel
    rapid growth by ca. 4500 BC; world's first cities


Early City States

 - Early City-States Period (4500-3100 BC). e.g. Uruk, Eridu, Ur
    population growth - 50,000+ people by 3100 BC
    9 km long wall, 250 ha settlement by 3100 BC
    tightly-packed houses, alleyways, courtyards, workshops
    Focal points - ziggurat complexes, temples
    class-based hierarchy; craft specialization (districts in Eanna), metallurgy
    writing by ca. 3500 BC (cuneiform)
    expansion / colonization northward: trade networks


Sumerian Civilization (3100 - 2334 BC)

 - city-state based economic system (e.g. Eridu, Uruk, Ur)
    trade links with Egypt, Anatolia, and Indus valley by ca. 3000 BC
 - need for raw materials: ore, soapstone, timber, grain
    easily moved along rivers, coastlines; overland by caravans
 - bronze - Syria ca. 3000 BC; imporved agricultural technologies, yields (surpluses)
 - with increases in food production + trade and exchange come...
    greater degrees of militarism
    greater degrees of social stratification
     - e.g. Royal Cemetery at Ur


Royal Cemetery at Ur

 - dates to ca. 2600-2100 BC
 - excavated by Leonard Woolley (British Museum) 1927-1928
 - 1850 burials; 16 'royal tombs'

    depicts battle scenes + feasts


Egyptian Civilization (5000-30 BC)

 - Predynastic
    5000-3100 BC
 - Dynastic
    3100-30 BC


Environmental Context

 - Nile River: low rainfall but predictable (spring-summer) flooding
 - use of 'passive' irrigation (e.g. dikes, basins)
    soil salinity not really a concern
 - Nile environments more 'steppe' than desert through Predynastic Period


Predynastic Period (5000-3100 BC)

 - simple farming villages tethered to Nile
 - gradual emergence of low-level chiefdoms
    disparity in trade, food surpluses, etc...
    Incipient city-states (taxes, fortifications, elite burial practices)

    Nagada, Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) and This (Abydos)
    Precursor to unification (proto-kingdom)
 - greater contact with SW Asia, Arabia (e.g. cylinder seals, gold)
 - military conquest (unification) by 3100 BC
    King Narmer (Menes)


Early Dynastic Period (3100-2575 BC)

 - Unification / consolidation of Lower and Upper Egypt under Narmer (Menes)
 - Emergence of:
    Pharaonic 'god-king'
    Centralized bureaucracy (capital at Memphis)
    Scribes - cursive hieroglyphic script


Old Kingdom (2575-2134 BC)

 - Full state-level society, e.g. 20,000+ army, differential mortuary practices; strict social hierarchy

================      mar23 (Complex Society in South and East Asia)      ===================



Harappan Civilization

Environmental Context
 - Indus River Valley - Eastern Pakistan / Western India
    total length is 3200km
 - July-Sept. floods = massive silt deposits (capped sites)
    similar to Mesopotamia

 - Walled towns (defense, flood control)
 - Lowland - Highland (Baluchistan) symbiosis
    metals, timber, semiprecious stones
    transhumance (goats and sheep)
 - Rapid transition to complexity in lowlands after 2800 BC
    population aggregations
    material culture becomes more uniform
     - Tied to Sumerian trade? Indigenous development?

Mature Stage (ca. 2500 - 2000 BC)
 - Territorial state (1.3 million km^2) with five major, heavily urbanized cities
 - Best known are Mohenjo-daro and Harappa
    centralized planning - cities laid out on grid system
    emphasis on hygiene (e.g. drainage systems, bathhouses)
    public buildings, but few palaces and ostentatious tombs

Mohenjo-daro

Mohenjodaro - Great Bath
 - large, brick-lined basin sealed with mortar and bitumen
 - ringed by pillared gallery
 - large well (adjacent) supplied water
 - 'sacred' or 'secular' use?

Mohenjo-daro - Great Granary
 - 50x27 m in extent, mud-brick foundation
 - 27 square blocks accessed by corridors
 - no evidence to support use as granary
    could be large public building

Record Keeping and the Indus Script
 - standardized system of weights and measures
 - cylinder seals with logographic script
    400-500 symbols, but few (max 26) used at any one time
    not yet deciphered

Government
 - No evidence for elite lifestyles (e.g. no monuments)
 - Lack of differential mortuary practices
 - Equitable distribution of wealth

Decline (ca. 1700 BC)
 - Dispersal into smaller settlements; material culture more diverse
 - Cause: Environmental Collapse?
    change in river flow (inundation) + soil salinity
    deforestation
 - Cause: Invasion?
    raiders from west or east Asia (lack of evidence)
