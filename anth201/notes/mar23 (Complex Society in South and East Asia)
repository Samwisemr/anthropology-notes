Harappan Civilization

Environmental Context
 - Indus River Valley - Eastern Pakistan / Western India
    total length is 3200km
 - July-Sept. floods = massive silt deposits (capped sites)
    similar to Mesopotamia
 - Village settlements tethered to river by ca. 3000 BC; widespread irrigation by 2500 BC

Early Stage (ca. 3200 - 2800 BC)
 - Walled towns (defense, flood control)
 - Lowland - Highland (Baluchistan) symbiosis
    metals, timber, semiprecious stones
    transhumance (goats and sheep)
 - Rapid transition to complexity in lowlands after 2800 BC
    population aggregations
    material culture becomes more uniform
     - Tied to Sumerian trade? Indigenous development?

Mature Stage (ca. 2500 - 2000 BC)
 - Territorial state (1.3 million km^2) with five major, heavily urbanized cities
 - Best known are Mohenjo-daro and Harappa
    centralized planning - cities laid out on grid system
    emphasis on hygiene (e.g. drainage systems, bathhouses)
    public buildings, but few palaces and ostentatious tombs

Mohenjo-daro
 - First constructed ca. 2600 BC; rebuilt 9 times
 - Major admin. centre; population of 35,000+
 - Two parts: Citadel and Lower City (largely unexcavated)
    Citadel
     - elevated, fortified (walled)
     - notable structures: Great Bath, 'Great Granary', Pillared Assembly Hall (court)

Mohenjodaro - Great Bath
 - large, brick-lined basin sealed with mortar and bitumen
 - ringed by pillared gallery
 - large well (adjacent) supplied water
 - 'sacred' or 'secular' use?

Mohenjo-daro - Great Granary
 - 50x27 m in extent, mud-brick foundation
 - 27 square blocks accessed by corridors
 - no evidence to support use as granary
    could be large public building

Record Keeping and the Indus Script
 - standardized system of weights and measures
 - cylinder seals with logographic script
    400-500 symbols, but few (max 26) used at any one time
    not yet deciphered

Government
 - No evidence for elite lifestyles (e.g. no monuments)
 - Lack of differential mortuary practices
 - Equitable distribution of wealth

Decline (ca. 1700 BC)
 - Dispersal into smaller settlements; material culture more diverse
 - Cause: Environmental Collapse?
    change in river flow (inundation) + soil salinity
    deforestation
 - Cause: Invasion?
    raiders from west or east Asia (lack of evidence)



Complex Society in China

3000 BC - AD 120
 - Chiefdoms    3000 - 2200 BC
    Longshan
 - States       2200 - 221 BC
    Xia, Shang and Zhou - the 'Three Dynasties'
 - Empires      221 -

Road to Complexity
 - horticulture / agriculture based on millet
 - early evidence in Yello River Valley, North China ca. 6500 BC
 - Yangshao Culture (ca. 4800 - 3200 BC)
    Terraced villages
    Egalitarian, semi-sedentary, mixed economies

Chiefdoms
 - Longshan (Lung-shan) ca 3000 - 2200 BC
    greater social complexity (e.g. elite burials); fortified towns
    technological innovations / craft specialization
     - copper metallurgy, potter's wheel, rammed-earth walls (hang-t'u)
    Origins of divination ceremony (Scapulimancy)
     - early writing

States
 - Shang Dynasty (1766 - 1122 BC)
    seven capitals; middle reaches of the Yellow River
    1557 BC - central capital established at Ao (Zhengzhou)
 - City of Ao
    Royal compound + earthen wall enclosed area of 5 km^2
     - (10,000 worker, 18 years); temples
    Flanked by residential quarters and craft workshops
     - Bronze, bone tool, pottery 'factories'
 - ca. 1400 BC - capital moved to Anyang (Yin)
 - rammed earth 'mounds'
 - royal residences - mud brick, timber frame surrounded by sacrifical burials (animals and humans)

Shang Royal Burials (ca. 1500 - 1200 BC)
 - 1200 simple burials; 11 deep burial pits (elite)
 - Elite burials; cross-like pits, ramps, attendants sacrificed, decapitated
 - Bronze works: sophisticated and elegant; vessels, weapons, horse tack
    tomb of Fu Hao (king) had 440 bronzes and 600 pieces of jade + 100s of other items
