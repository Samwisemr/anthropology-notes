Recall

 - Colonization of NA after 15 kya
    earliest groups known as Paleoindians
 - ca. 10 kya in NA: broad spectrum economies
    'Archaic Period' populations
    h&g; small mammals, fish, seeds and nuts


ENA - Introduction

 - Major periods in ENA archaeology
    Paleoindian 10,000 - 8000 BC
    Archaic 8,000 - 2000 BC
    Early Woodland 2000 BC - AD 1
    Middle Woodland AD 1 - 500
    Late Woodland (NE) AD 500 - contact
    Mississippian (SE) AD 500 - contact


Early Woodland

 - After 2000 BC, we see the following developments in ENA
    Increased sedentism / decreased mobility
    Increased reliance on plant foods (Midwest)
    Pottery
    Increased social complexity
    More elaborate burial mound construction
    More elaborate inter-regional exchange


Eastern Agricultural Complex

 - Plants in the EAC include squash and gourd, sunflower, marsh elder, and goosefoot
    all had edible seeds, either oily (sunflower, marsh elder) or starchy (goosefoot, maygrass knotweed, little barley)
 - most EAC plants thrive in open, disturbed habitats like river floodplains (occupied by humans since Early Archaic)
 - Wild rice also likely an important resource in many areas


Adena and Hopewell

 - Between 500 BC and AD 400, Adena and Hopewell groups:
    Built extensive earthworks including mounds
    Had mortuary rituals involving the use of charnel houses and log-lined tombs
    Manufactured elaborately-carved pipes, birdstones (atlatl weights)
 - After AD 1, Hopewell groups:
    participated in more elaborate inter-regional exchange
     - Hopewell Interaction Sphere
    developed a distinctive religious iconography / ideology
    Began to cultivate maize (after ca. AD 200)


The Mississippian Tradition

 - Between AD 500 and European contact, we see the following developments in the Midwest and SE
    Collapse of Hopewell and the HIS
    Intensification of food production (maize horticulture)
    Chiefdom level of social organization (Mississipian Tradition) with six regional variants
 - Between AD 900 and 1300, we see the:
    Emergence and decline of 'towns'
     - e.g., Cahokia, Moundville
    Construction of platform mounds
    Southeastern Ceremonial Cult iconography and ideology


Cahokia

 - Monk's Mound: four terraces, 5.6 ha, 30 m high
    more than twice the size of any other mound at Cahokia; focal point for community (region?)
 - Once supported series of structures (inc. chief's house)
 - immense plaza immediately to the south
