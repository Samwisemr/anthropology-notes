Hominin (Hominid)
 - Primates of the family Hominidae
 - Includes modern humans, earlier human subspecies and their direct ancestors
    essentially, all species that emerged after the Pan-Homo divergence ca. 7 mya
 - Typically identified by bipedal adaptations

Bidpedalism
 - Upright posture and gait; opposed to quadrupedalism or knuckle-walking
 - Adaptation to tropical (savanna) environments
    Increase in time spent on the ground
    Long-distance travel; endurance
 - Occurs sometime after 10 mya; certainly by 4 mya

Sahelanthropus tchadensis
 - aka "Toumai" - mostly complete cranium
 - Discovered in west-central Chad, 2001
 - Estimated Age - 7 to 6 mya (probably closer to 7 mya)
 - Small brain (320-380 cubic centimetres(cc) ); comparable to chimpanzees
 - Occipital (back) of cranium looks like chimpanzee
 - Frontal (facial structure and dental arcade) - more like Australopithecine ca. 1.75 mya
 - No post-cranial fragments
    Bipedalism suggested by the anterior (as opposed to posterior) position of the foramen magnum
 - Could be ancestor of Ardipithecus

Australopithecus afarensis
 - Likely emerged ca. 4 mya in East Africa
 - Best known specimen - "Lucy"; remarkably complete
 - Discovered by Donald Johanson in 1974, Afar region of Ethiopia
 - Dated to ca. 3.2 mya
 - Height: 1.2 m (4 ft); Female, 19-21 years old
 - Would have been powerful with a stocky, muscular build
 - Fully bipedal
 - Curved arms and fingers associated with earlier tree climbers
 - Other notable finds:
    Footprints in volcanic ash at Laetoli in Tanzania by Mary Leakey in 1978
    Dated to 3.6 mya
    Confirms bipedalism in A. afarensis
    Notably... bipedalism predates tool making and large cranial capacity

Split
 - ca. 3 mya, the descendents of A. afarensis split into two distinct lines
    Gracile Line - A. africanus, A. garhi
     - A. Africanus found in South Africa; A. garhi in East Africa
    Robust Line - A. robustus, A. boisei,
     - Found in both South Africa and East Africa
 - There are likely other (as yet unidentified) lines

Australopithecus garhi
 - Discovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, 1996
 - Dated to ca. 2 mya
 - Height: 1.46 m (4ft 10in); "chimp-like" prognathism; cranial capacity ~400-500 cc
 - May have been the first to butcher animals
    if so, A. garhi would be the earliest tool user

Robust Australopithecines
 - South Africa - A. robustus fossils first found at Swartkrans by Robert Broom in 1948
 - East Africa - A. bosei fossils found by Mary Leakey in the Olduvai Gorge region of Tanzania in 1959
 - Dated to between 3 and 1 mya
 - Heavily-built, with small brains (~ 500 cc) and large teeth
    consistent with a diet based on fibrous plant foods
 - Sagittal crest indicates string jaw muscles
    present in large apes, but not in A. Africanus or Homo

Adaptive Radiation
 - Theory used to understand how hominin species can overlap in the fossil record
 - Refers to the diversification of a species as it adapts to different ecological niches
    First radiation: bipdal apes which lived in the more arid regions of Africa
    Two later radiations (presumably out of A. afarensis ca. 3 mya) gave rise to the robust line of Australopithecines and early Homo

Homo habilis
 - "Handy person" - assumed tool-making abilities
 - First discovered by Louis and Mary Leakey in Bed 1 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in 1960
 - Decrease in prognathism; higher, rounder cranium
 - Increase in cranial capacity: 600-700 cc
    Thought to correlate with capacity to make stone tools, better exploit landscape
 - Omnivorous
 - Biped, but retained ability to climb trees
    Similar lengths in humeri/femora
    Similar to chimpanzees, but not like us
 - H. habilis may have spent a great deal of time in wooded environments

Overall Biological Trends
 - Influenced by shift in the mode of locomotion from quadrupedalism to bipedalism
 - Major changes:
    Increased cranial capacity
    Decreased prognathism
    Shape of Pelvis
     - Shortened and broadened illium (section of pelvic girdle above hip socket)
     - Provides for complex muscle attachments needed to maintain balance while walking
 - Foramen Magnum
    Back of cranium - quadrupedal locomotion (e.g. apes)
    Closer to face - bipedal locomotion (e.g. humans)
     - cranium of humans is balanced on top of the spinal column
 - Dental Arcade
    Tied to decrease in prognathism
    Chimpanzees have a narrow, U-shaped arcade with elongated canines
    A. Afarensis has an intermediate V-shaped arcade
    Modern humans have a wider, parabolic arcade

Origins of Human Culture
 - We see with Homo habilis, for the first time, evidence of learned behaviour in the form of:
    Tool Use (the Oldowan Tool Tradition)
    Subsistence / Settlement practices (home bases)
    Social Organization

Early Tool Use: The Oldowan
 - Earliest (?) "human" technology - the Oldowan
    Beginning of the Lower Paleolithic Period
 - Simple tools; East Africa (Olduvai Gorge), ca. 2.5 mya
    Coincides with the emergence of H. habilis
 - Consists of large pebble choppers with flakes removed at one end
    Flakes could have been used for a variety of tasks
