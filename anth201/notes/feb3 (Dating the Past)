Dating the Past
 - What are we dating?
    Direct Dating: dates the artifact/ecofact
     - preferred
    Indirect Dating: dates the context
     - good, but subject to increased error

 - Kinds of dates
    Relative: one artifact or level is younger/older than another
    Chronometric(Absolute): can determine age in calendar years (e.g., BP, BC, BCE, AD); subject to error


Relative Dating Techniques
 - Seriation
 - Stratigraphy
 - Obsidian Hydration


Seriation
 - Technique used to order artifactual materials from one or more context(s)
 - Based on subtle changes through time/space
 - Premise: Adjacent materials should be more similar to one another than non-adjacent materials

 - Typical assumption re:patterning
    Introduction -> Fluorescence -> Decline
 - This pattern is referred to as a unimodal distribution or 'battleship curve'

 - Other assumptions:
    each unit represents a relatively brief and comparable block of time
    all units belong to the same cultural tradition
    all units come from a reasonably small region

 - Provides us with a linear order, but...
 - No guarantee the order proceeds from oldest to youngest, unless there is chronometric evidence to back it up


Obsidian Hydration
 - Refers to absorption of water by volcanic glass after fracturing
 - Hyrdration layers (rinds) can be measured microscopically
 - Layers increase in thickness through time
 - Rate of hydration must be known
 - Rate affected by temperature, exposure and material


Chronometric Dating
 - Calendar
 - Non-Radiometric (Dendrochronology)
 - Radiometric (carbon Dating, Potassium Argon)
 - Trapped Energy (Thermoluminescence)


Case Study: Mesoamerican Calendars
 - Long Count
 - Ceremonial Calendar
 - Solar Calendar


Long Count
 - base-20/base-18 calendar
 - Records number of days since the world was created(corresponds to August 11, 3114 BCE)
 - Occasionally found on monuments (e.g. Stela C, site of Tres Zapotes [Olmec] September 3, 32 BCE)


Ceremonial Calendar
 - Known as the Tzolk'in (Mayan calendar) but is found as far back as Olmec times
 - 20 named days x 13 cycles = 260 day year
 - Among Maya, articulates with solar (Haab') calendar


Solar Calendar (Maya)
 - Known as the Haab'
 - 18 months x 20 days = 360 days + 5 "dangerous days"
    periodic 'corrections' instead of leap years
 - Articulates with ceremonial calendar
    each named day would not reappear for 18,980 days or 52 of our solar years


Dendrochronology
 - Tree-ring dating of preserved wood
 - Chronologies based on overlapping ring sequences
 - Limitations:
    cannot be used in tropical regions
    limited to certain tree species


Radiocarbon (^14C) Dating (INCOMPLETE)
 - Radioactive isotope or 'variety' of carbon which forms in the atmosphere
 - Absorbed by plants during photosynthesis
 - Absorbed by animals when they eat plants

 - Libby(creator of technique)'s calculations were based on a 'curve of knowns'
 - Compared Egyptian tree-ring data to radiocarbon samples

 - Two forms
    Conventional:


    AMS: direct counting of ^14C atoms
     - more expensive, but...
     - more accurate
     - faster results (atoms counted in minutes)
     - can get away with smaller samples (~100 mg or less)
     - fewer labs

 - Calibration
    conversion to date in calendrical years
    necessary because of atmospheric fluctuation in carbon levels through time
    makes use of Calibration curves
    curves based on comparison of sample ^14C dates with dates obtained through other means
