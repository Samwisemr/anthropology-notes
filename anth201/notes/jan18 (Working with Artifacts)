Artifact Processing
 - Cleaning
 - [Conservation]
	may or may not be necessary, depending on the artifact class
 - Cataloguing
 - Classification


Artifact Organization
 - Involves classification
	process by which we assign items to categories(classes) in a pre-arrange	d system
	rules determine whether an item belongs or does not belong to a class
 - Typically, we make the following general distinctions based on material:
	Lithics
	Ceramics
	Metal
	Bone(Faunal)
	Wood


Lithics
 - Display evidence of reduction
 - Can be further subdivided into:
	chipped or flaked lithic tools, plus debitage(waste)
	ground stone tools


Flaked Lithic Tools
 - 'Flintknapping" - one of earliest industrial arts
 - Emerged with Homo habilis some 2.5 mya
 - Involves removing flakes from cores in a controlled manner, using the principle of conchoidal fracture
 - Concentric circle like breakage pattern
 - How we identify manmake tools


Conchoidal Fracture
 - Igneous materials such as obsidian(a volcanic glass) and sedimentary materials such as flint or chert are best for controlling fracture. Why?
	they are homogeneous
	they are brittle
	(flints/cherts) have what is called a cryptocrystalline structure


Flaking Techniques
 - Hard-Hammer Percussion
 - Soft-Hammer Percussion
 - Pressure Flaking
 - Bipolar Reduction

Method 1: Hard-Hammer Percussion
 - Involves directly striking the core with a hammerstone or some other very hard percusser

Method 2: Soft-Hammer Percussion
 - Similar in nature to Hard-Hammer
 - The percusser, though, often consists of a billet made of wood, bone, or antler

Method 3: Pressure Flaking
 - Uses beding force to detach flakes, which leaves flatter, smaller cones
 - used for more precise flake removal along tool margins

Method 4: Bipolar Reduction
 - Percussion flaking coupled with an anvil
 - force travels through the core and rebounds back up, causing the flake to detach
 - Cones are often found at both the proximal and distal ends of a flake


Ground Stone Lithic Tools
 - Produced by pecking, abrading and polishing macrocrystalline materials
 - Ground stone tools usually have smooth durable edges and surfaces. Decorative items can also be made from ground stone


Ceramics
 - Relatively recent invention, ca. last 18,000 years
 - Made from the mixture of clay, water and temper, which is then fired
 - Temper helps to reduce shrinkage and cracking

Ceramics - forming methods
 - Can be divided into the following:
	hand-forming
	molding
	wheel-throwing
 - These methods leave distinctive signatures on vessels which can lead to inferences regarding construction practices

Forming Methods - Pinching
 - The simplest forming technique
 - Involves squeezing a ball of clay into the desired form
 - Signatures: presence of shallow indentations left by the fingertips of othe potter

Forming Methods - Coiling
 - Snake-like cylinders of clay rolled around the circumference of the pot
 - Signature: evidence of smoothed-over and compressed cylinders in wall profiles

Forming Methods - Slab Building
 - Similar to coil construction, instead of coils, slabs of clay are attached by pinching
 - Typically more boxlike structures
