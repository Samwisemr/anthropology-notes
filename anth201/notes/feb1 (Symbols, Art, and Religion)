Introduction
 - Topic is intimately bound up with ideology
    how people structure their ideas about the world and their place in it
 - Thought by some to be beyond the reach of archaeology
    epiphenomenal - the realm of ideas
    resistant to culture change
 - Often explored in feminist, Marxist, and postprocessual archaeologies


What is a symbol?
 - Dictionary Definition:
    Something that stands for something else
    Based on an arbitrary relationship, e.g. words in a language
     - Works for the "linguistic sign" but what about material practises?
 - But is this enough to effectively characterize the "symbolic" properties of material culture?
 - Can material culture signify in other ways?
 - A more robust, semiotic model is based on the sign types of Charles Peirce (1838-1914)


The Archaeology of Symbols
 - How have symbols been conceptualized by archaeologists?


Symbols in Structuralism
 e.g., Leroi-Gourhan's (1982) analysis of French Palaeolithic cave art
 - binary oppositions between "male" animals such as bison and "female" animals such as horses
 - Cave art as "mythogram"; symbols can be read as a text for meaning


Symbols in Processualism
 e.g., Polly Wiessner (1983)
 - Symbols operate within two distinct realms of style:
    emblemic style: clear and conscious messages re: group affiliation or identity
    assertive style: messages related to individual identity


The Trouble with Symbols
 - Two problems with the above:
    what of "material agency"?
    What of historical context?
     - understanding is always situated and contextual


Art and Aesthetics
 - Key terms:
    Art: in effect, the rendering of "symbols" generally within a certain stylistic tradition
    Style: distinctive patterning of elements recognized within a group as appropriate for a particular kind of art
 - Some problems with art as an analytical category:
    in the modern west, art is seen as a realm of culture
    as well, it is something to be appreciated for its beauty
    good art is also prized
 - Few other cultures view "art" in such a way, and this was likely true in the past as well
 - Not only is art "culture-bound" but our understanding of it is mediated by aesethetics


Oldest-known Art
 - Upper Paleolithic period, ca. 30-10 kya
 - Parietal(cave) and mobiliary(portable) art
 - Distribution: North Africa to Siberia; major concentrations in SW France, Northern Spain, Central and Eastern Europe
 - Parietal Art
    engraved and painted animals and humans, hands and geometric shapes
    charcoal, ochre, hematite used
 - Mobiliary Art
    many different media - clay, wood, fibre, hides, only a small portion of which survives today
    engraved antler, bone and ivory
