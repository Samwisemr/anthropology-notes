General Evironmental Context

 - Highlands: mountains, lakes and deep river valleys
    backdrop for inter-regional exchange
    origins of food production
 - Lowlands: tropical forests (south) and scrublands (north)
    virtual absence of large rivers and alluvial plains
    use of "cenotes" and, occasionally, canals for portable water


Economy

 - No domesticated animals
    no milk, transport, or draft animals
 - 'Slash and burn' horticulture
    forests cleared through burning; crop rotations (fallow fields)
 - maize, bean, and squash + ramon nut (breadnut), rabbit, dear, fish, shellfish



The Olmec (1500 - 500 BC)


 - 'Founding population'; earliest evidence for political complexity
 - Sophisticated artistic tradition
 - Two major ceremonial sites: San Lorenzo and La Venta

La Venta (ca. 900 - 400 BC)

 - Complex of mounds, platforms, pyramids, plazas ca. 5 km^2
 - 34m high 'fluted cone' earthen mound (Tuxtla volcano?)

Olmec Colossal Head La Venta

 - 4 at La Venta
 - Carved from basalt
 - Ritually buried
 - Portrait of ruler / priest?

 - Olmec culture reached its peak by ca. 900 BC
 - Major inland trade with Highland Mesoamerica by this time
    Jade, iron ore, obsidian
    Magnetite mirrors
    Shark's teeth, Stingray spines
    Cocoa
    Pottery
 - Many sites destroyed (and buried) between ca. 700 - 400 BC



The Maya (1000 BC - AD 1519)

 - Maya Lowlands (Broader Yucatan Peninsula)
    Preclassic      1000 BC - 
    .....................
    Postclassic

Classic Maya
AD 300 - 900

 - Independent city-states
    e.g. sites of Tikal, Palenque, Copan
    not heavily urbanized
 - Occupational specializations, e.g. pottery
 - Monumental architecture, eg. pyramids
 - Refinements in calendar and writing
    MAYANS RECORDED HISTORY AS OPPOSED TO DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES ETC

Tikal (ca. AD 292 - 869)

 - Guatemala, pop. 77,000+ (inc. surrounding area); 16 km^2
 - 3000 structures, only handful excavated
    pyramid-temple complex, plazas, ballcourts, causeways
 - reservoirs for rainfall collection
    major technological accomplishment
 - 31 rulers; royal dynasties (inscribed stelae)
 - Extensive interaction with (and rule over) neighbouring communities
 - Contact and trade with highlands (Teotihuacan); likely conquered by ruler of Teotihuacan in AD 378
 - Defeated by Caracol in AD 557; decline as power centre



Highland Mesoamerica

 - Valley of Mexico
    Teotihuacan     (city-state, ca. 200 BC - AD 750)
    Toltec Empire   (ca. AD 650 - 1200)
    Aztec Empire    (ca. AD 1200 - 1521)

 - Site of Teotihuacan (ca. 200 BC - AD 750)
    Valley of Mexico, ca. 40 km NE of Mexico City; 21 km^2
    Massive urbanized city-state:
     - AD 100           80,000+ inhabitants
     - AD 200 - 600     150,000+ inhabitants
    Significant urban planning and monumental architecture
     - Street of the Dead (focal N-S axis)
     - 600 pyramids
     - 500 workshops; 2000 apartment complexes
     - urban implosion (ethnic barrios)
     - great marketplace and other plazas
     - no fortifications
    Decline after AD 600
     - Environmental collapse?
     - revolt?
