Geoarchaeology & Paleoecology

Introduction
 - Involves using methods and techniques from earth sciences to inform archaeological research
 - Typically entails the reconstuction of:
	past landscapes
	depositional environments, and
	palaeoclimate
 - Helpful for interpreting site-formation processes, subsistence activities, and landscape use

Geophysics
 - Geophysical or physiographic elements impart a physical structure to the landscape, which affects:
	land travel
	water navigations
	surface drainage
	biotic communities
	access to portable water
    access to mineral resources
    availability of arable soils suitable for agriculture
    suitalbe campsites and settlement locations


Layer Cake Approach
 - Describe past geo-physical environment
    begin with bedrock geology and landforms
    add surficial geology, hydrography and landforms
    add soils
    add climate
 - Describe past bio-physical environment
    add vegetation
    interpret animal habitats

Soils
 - Refers to the uppermost layers of the Earth's surface
 - Contains organic/inorganic materials brought together over time through various pedological processes
 - These processes provide the soil with depth(profile) and tend to organize soils into layers or zones(horizons)
 - Most soil horizons are classified archaeologically as A, B, and C
 - A horizon
    closest to the surface
    consists of topsoils with humus
 - B horizon
    contains materials which have leached down through rainwater filtering
 - C horizon
    consists of inorganic soils or bedrock from which the A/B horizons emerged


Geomorphology
 - Some pedological terms:
 - Colluvium
    soils which gather at the bases of slopes due to rain and gravity
 - Loess
    refers to wind-deposited sediments
 - Colluvium and Loess are typically deposited on top of existing A-horizon materials
    when this occurs, the original A-horizon is a palaeosol
 - Materials which are redeposited through the forces of moving water are referred to as alluvium
    Recall: most sites are located within 200m of water
 - Floodplains and river deltas are composed of alluvium and are formed through such processes
 - Floodplains are often referred to as alluvial terraces
    they document the deposition of alluvium through time as rivers meander back and forth across the landscape
 - As riverbeds become deeper, they leave behind alluvial terraces of different heights and ages
